## last.fm api
For this web app, I use data from the [last.FM api](https://www.last.fm/api). The documentation is very easy to follow
which was a great help when getting started. I already knew that I wanted to work with data about genre's and albums so
I was able to get started right away. last.fm has a variety of links described in their documentation about what link
you need to call in order to get data and what the data you will receive looks like. The link I decided to use was 
```
JSON: /2.0/?method=tag.gettopalbums&tag=disco&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&format=json 
```
In order to use this link, you need to add an api key, this can be gained by creating an account. Passing a genre (or as the api calls it, tag)
with the url is required, I changed this to metalcore. The url can also be changed to set a limit of albums to be fetched, the
standard is 50 which I decided to keep for testing, this could easily be changed to a larger number for production
By using a XMLHttpRequest on the link, I was able to get the data quite easily. The data I recieved looked like this:

Each album has a name, a url to the related page on last.fm, a unique identifyer, information about the artist and 4 formats
of album art. This structure is repeated for each album, making it easy to create a template which I can fill with data.
